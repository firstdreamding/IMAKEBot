Name: Rutgers Esports
University: Rutgers University
Description: We pride ourselves on being an open, friendly, and diverse community. Everyone is welcome here, no matter who you are or where you come from. Rutgers Esports was first founded in Fall 2014 by a small group of gaming club leaders at Rutgers University. They came together with a shared vision, a place for all gamers, no matter who they are, what they play, or how seriously they play it, to call home. Since that day, Rutgers Esports has grown from a handful of scattered gaming clubs to a thriving, unified community for all gamers.
